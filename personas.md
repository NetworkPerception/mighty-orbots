It is essential to identify the needs of users who will directly use the MonitorMe system. We have come up with user personas early in architecture development so that they can guide a product that will serve users' best interests.

### Nancy, the Nurse

Nancy is a nurse who works with patients in her station. Her job consists of regular rounds with her patients and monitoring various situations that she can either act on or report to others for guidance.

Her day is spent walking between the rooms, and her time is at a premium. She prefers anything that can save her a trip to a room because by being with one patient, she can't quickly check on the others. But even with that, she must visit each room multiple times daily. So, her time at the Nurses' Station is at a premium because it won't be long until she has to head to a patient.

She understands the operation of a hospital room, so she values information that helps her do her job by giving her information she might only sometimes have.

### David, the Doctor

David works with many patients at many hospitals, so he is rarely at one location for long. He has to get in, work, and head off to another patient. Often, if he is a surgeon or other specialist, his time is spent practicing his procedures and is frequently uninterruptible.

Because he is often a contract-type worker at the hospital, his methods have to cross hospital systems, and he has to be well-versed in different configurations. David has to leave instructions for the day-to-day of his patients, and he comes back either for scheduled times or emergencies.

### Alice, the Nurse Administrator

Alice could be a nurse herself, but often, she is the one helping coordinate bringing patients in/out of different hospital sections. As a result, she is the one coordinating patient entry & leaving. She needs a global picture to make her decisions as possible.

Her work is done around the edges and usually is not horribly time-critical unless occupancy or staffing issues exist. When a patient arrives or leaves, usually, that doesn't require immediate attention.

### Sarah, the System Administrator

Sarah is responsible for the understanding and upkeep of all of the hospital systems. Since the patient's well-being is involved, she must be 1) available at a moment's notice to troubleshoot and 2) keep the systems working all the time. Her _five-nines_ goal means she is constantly trying to stay ahead of issues and perform maintenance at times that will not stress out the function of systems. She could be notified in a disaster, but she'd prefer to have that situation covered ahead of time and not have to scramble to bring a system back up.
