## Personas


# Nancy the Nurse

Nancy is a nurse who works with patients in her station. Her job consists of regular rounds to her patients, as well as monitoring various situations that she can either act on or report to others for guidance.

Her day is spent walking between the rooms, and her time is at a premium. She prefers anything that can save her a trip to a room, because by being with one patient, she can't easily be checking on the others. But even with that, she is required to visit each room multiple times a day. So her time at the Nurses' Station is at a premium, because it won't be long until she has to head to a patient.

She understands the operation of a hospital room, so she values information that helps her do her job by giving her information she might not always have.

# David the Doctor

David works with many patients at many hospitals, so he's rarely at one location for long. He has to get in, do his work, and head off to another patient. Many times, if he's a surgeon or other specialist, his time is spent in practice doing his procedures, and he often is uninterruptable at these times.

Because he's often a contract-type worker at the hospital, his methods have to cross hospital systems, and he has bto be well versed in different configurations. David has to leave instructions for the day-to-day of his patients, and he comes back either for scheduled times or emergencies.

# Alice the Nurse Administrator

Alice could be a nurse herself, but often times she's the one helping coordinate bringing patients in/out of different sections of the hospital. As a result, she's the one coordinating patient entry & leaving. To make her decisions, she needs as global of a picture as possible.

Her work is done around the edges, and usually isn't horribly time-critical, unless there are occupancy or staffing issues. When a patient arrives or leaves, usually that isn't requiring immediate attention.

# Sarah the System Administrator

Sarah is responsible for the understanding and upkeep of all of the hospital systems. Since patients' well being is involved, she must be 1) available at a moment's notice to troubleshoot, and 2) be able to keep the systems working all the time. Her five nines goal means she's constantly trying to stay ahead of issues and perform maintenance on down times that won't stress out the function of systems. She could be notified in a disaster, but she'd prefer to have that situation covered ahead of time and not have to scramble to bring a system back up.
