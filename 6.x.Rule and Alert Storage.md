We have provisioned three types of rules on sensor readings that would trigger alerts. Each of these rules is also associated with the patient's sleep/awake status.

### State Trigger
The state trigger performs an alert when a sensor status changes. Three possible rules are available in a state trigger as depicted below:

![State Trigger](/images/rule_state.png)

**Note**: In addition to the sensor state, there might also be a message or image accompanying the change. This extra data, when available, will be attached to the alert sent.

| Rule Setting | Description|
|---|---|
|When sensor state is [...]|Select the status that triggers an alert: <li>**Down**: Trigger an alert if a sensor changes to the Down status.</li><li>**Warning**: Trigger an alert if a sensor changes to the Warning status.</li><li>**Unusual**: Trigger an alert if a sensor changes to the Unusual status.</li><li>**Up**: Trigger an alert if a sensor changes to the Up status.</li><li>**Unknown**: Trigger an alert if a sensor changes to the Unknown status</li>|
|for at least [...] seconds|Enter the time in seconds before the trigger sends an alert (latency). This can avoid false alarms if, for example, a sensor changes to the Down status for only a few seconds. Enter an integer. Do not define a latency that is shorter than the scanning interval of a sensor that uses this trigger.|
|perform [...]|Select the alert sent if the sensor is in the selected status and if the defined latency is over.|
|When sensor state is [...] for at least [...] seconds|Enter the escalation latency in seconds to wait before sending an escalation alert. Use this to escalate an alert automatically if a problem exists for a longer time. Enter an integer.|
|and repeat every [...] minute|Enter the interval in minutes after which send the escalation alert again. Enter an integer.|
|When the sensor state is no longer [...] , perform [...]|Select the alert to send if the sensor is no longer in the selected status and the defined latency is over. |



### Threshold Trigger
The threshold trigger performs an alert when a sensor reading reaches a specific value.

| Rule Setting | Description|
|---|---|
|When [sensor data X]|Select the sensor data available for the type of sensor this trigger is associated with. Note: the exact name of the sensor data will be retrieved from the database. 
|is [...]|Select the condition that triggers the alert from the fixed values below: <li>**Above**: Trigger the alert if the value of the selected sensor data exceeds a defined value.</li><li>**Below**: Trigger the alert if the value of the selected sensor data falls below a defined value.</li><li>**Equal to**: Trigger the alert if the value of the selected sensor data is the same as a defined value.</li><li>**Not equal to**: Trigger the alert if the value of the selected sensor data is different from a defined value.</li>|
|[value]|Enter the value that compares the sensor data. |
|for at least [...] seconds|Enter the time in seconds to wait before sending an alert (latency). |
|perform [...]|Select the alert to send if the defined sensor data condition is true and the defined latency is over. |
|When the condition clears, perform [...]|Select the alert to send if the defined sensor data condition is no longer true and the defined latency is over. |


### Change Trigger
The change trigger performs an alert when a compatible sensor's value changes.

**Note**: The ECG sensor might be linked to a more elaborate system computing anomalies. These anomalies could be seen as a change triggering an alert.

| Rule Setting | Description|
|---|---|
|When the sensor changes, perform [...]|Select the alert to send if a compatible sensor triggers a change alert. |
