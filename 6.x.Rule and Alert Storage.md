## Rules and Alerts
Three types of alert triggers are supported based on sensor readings:
- The state trigger performs an alert when a sensor changes its status.
- The threshold trigger performs an alert if a sensor reaches specific values.
- The change trigger performs an alert if a compatible sensor's value changes.

Most rules are associated with a specific stage the patient is in when the rule is computed (awake or asleep)

### State Trigger
The state trigger performs an alert when a sensor changes its status. Three possible rule are available in a state trigger as depicted and described below:

**Note**: in addition to the sensor state, there might also be a message or image accompanying the change. This extra data, when available, will be attached to the alert sent.

| Rule Setting | Description|
|---|---|
|When sensor state is [...]|Select the status that triggers an alert: <li>**Down**: Trigger an alert if a sensor changes to the Down status.</li><li>**Warning**: Trigger an alert if a sensor changes to the Warning status.</li><li>**Unusual**: Trigger an alert if a sensor changes to the Unusual status.</li><li>**Up**: Trigger an alert if a sensor changes to the Up status.</li><li>**Unknown**: Trigger an alert if a sensor changes to the Unknown status</li>|
|for at least [...] seconds|Enter the time in seconds before the trigger sends an alert (latency). This can avoid false alarms if, for example, a sensor changes to the Down status for only a few seconds. Enter an integer. Do not define a latency that is shorter than the scanning interval of a sensor that uses this trigger.|
|perform [...]|Select the alert sent if the sensor is in the selected status and if the defined latency is over.|
|When sensor state is [...] for at least [...] seconds|Enter the escalation latency in seconds to wait before sending an escalation alert. Use this to automatically escalate an alert if a problem exists for a longer time. Enter an integer.|
|and repeat every [...] minutes|Enter the interval in minutes after which send the escalation alert again. Enter an integer.|
|When sensor state is no longer [...] , perform [...]|Select the alert to send if the sensor is no longer in the selected status and if the defined latency is over. |



### Threshold Trigger
The threshold trigger performs an alert if a sensor reaches specific values

![Threshold Trigger](/images/rule_threshold.png)

| Rule Setting | Description|
|---|---|
|When [sensor data X]|Select the sensor data available for the type of sensor this trigger is associated with. Note: the exact name of the sensor data will be retrieved from the database. 
|is [...]|Select the condition that triggers the alert from the fixed values below: <li>**Above**: Trigger the alert if the value of the selected sensor data exceeds a defined value.</li><li>**Below**: Trigger the alert if the value of the selected sensor data falls below a defined value.</li><li>**Equal to**: Trigger the alert if the value of the selected sensor data is the same as a defined value.</li><li>**Not equal to**: Trigger the alert if the value of the selected sensor data is different from a defined value.</li>|
|[value]|Enter the value to which compare the sensor data. |
|for at least [...] seconds|Enter the time in seconds to wait before sending an alert (latency). |
|perform [...]|Select the alert to send if the defined sensor data condition is true and the defined latency is over. |
|When condition clears, perform [...]|Select the alert to send if the defined sensor data condition is no longer true and the defined latency is over. |


### Change Trigger
The change trigger performs an alert if a compatible sensor's value changes. 

**Note**: some elaborate sensors like the ECG might be linked to a more elaborate system computing anomalies. 
These anomalies could be seen as a change triggering an alert.

| Rule Setting | Description|
|---|---|
|When sensor changes, perform [...]|Select the alert to send if a compatible sensor triggers a change alert. |
