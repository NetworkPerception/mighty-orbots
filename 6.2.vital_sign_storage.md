As depicted in the schema diagram above, the vital signs are stored in a time series database using *tags* representing different sensor types. Specifically, a record in this database is comprised of one tag name, multiple data points, and multiple attributes. A data point constitutes a timestamp and measurement. Finally, the attributes are key-value pairs describing various sensor-specific details. Note that some sensors, like the ECG, are more complex than others and need additional attributes.

| Term | Required | Definition |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Tag | x | Name of a tag (e.g., temperature), which is non-unique. Howerver, a specific sensor's ID is stored as an attribute in the Attributes section. |
| Timestamp | x | The date and time in UNIX epoch time, in millisecond precision. |
| Measurement| x | The value produced by the sensor without a unit of measurement. |
|Attribute| | Key/Value pairs used to store data associated with the tag. Some mandatory ones are: hub ID, room ID, patient ID, and sensor ID. Other optional ones might be needed for more complex sensor types, such as ECG. |

  
### Supported Queries
The database will provide REST APIs for querying and aggregating time series data. Such query include:
- Read data for specific tags within a desired time window
- Filter data by attribute values
- Retrieve all available tags and their associated attribute keys
- Add aggregate values
- Interpolate data points in a given time window
- Read the latest values for a specific sensor type
