## Vital Sign Data Model
### Data Ingestion
The vital signs are stored in a time series database on the idea of tags, which represent different types of values measured by sensors (i.e. a temperature  or blood pressure).
A data record consists of one tag name (sensor type) and multiple datapoints, each comprised of a timestamp (time) and a measurement (value). 
The overall record can contain multiple attributes (key/value pairs) describing the asset. 
Some sensors like the ECG will be more complex than other more simple sensors and additional options and attributes could be added.

| Term | Definition |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Tag name | (Required) Name of the tag (for example Temperature). This is not a unique value, and typically numerous sensors of the same type will share this same tag name. The sensor id is stored as an attribute in the Attributes section.|
| Timestamp | (Required) The date and time in UNIX epoch time, with millisecond precision.|
| Measurement|(Required) The value produced from the sensor. Does not include the unit of measurement.|
|Attribute| Key/Value pairs used to store data associated with a tag. Some mandatory ones are the hub id, room id, patient id and sensor id. Other optional ones could be added for more complex sensor types, like ECG.|

  ### Data Consumption
  The database typically provides REST APIS for querying and aggregating time series data allowing to:
    - query data specifying tags and a time window
    - filter by attribute values
    retrieve all tags and attribute keys from the time series database
    - add aggregates and interpolate data points in a given time window
    - query the time series database for the latest values
