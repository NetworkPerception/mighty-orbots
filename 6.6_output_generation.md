## 6.6  Output Generation

The system generates three types of outputs:

* alerts and notifications
* updates to the monitoring screen
* patient history and reports

> Unlike the first two, patient history is initiated by a user, and dependent on input from the user. These requests come from the admin screen at a nurse's station. We decided to consider this as part of the data adminitstration component. Let's consider notifications, and updates to the screen as the output generated. 

Alerts and updates are important events that serve the main functionality of the system. The screen is constantly updating, and alerts must reported as soon as possible. We decided to make this component in the architecture event-driven. As soon as newer sensor data is availiable, the monitoring screen will display it.

Consider how a notification makes it to the nurse's screen. The notification issuer, that is in charge of displaying the notification, should poll the alerts database, to retrieve the newest alerts added. The rule processor is in charge of applying the rules to sensor data, and adding alerts to the alerts database. The rule processor should poll the sensor input database, to retrieve the newest sensor data added. Each event is pushed by the process before it.
